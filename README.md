This repo stores the code for our Math 214 Final Project Demo. When the crypto.py program is run, the user is prompted to select between the two modes.
Mode 1 will then prompt the user for a word and show the process of encrypting and decrypting using the Hill Cypher.
Mode 2 will prompt the user for 4 numbers and will use those numbers as a key to attempt to decrypt a decrypted message.
